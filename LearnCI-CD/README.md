# ðŸš€ CI/CD Pipeline â€“ First Steps

This file starts with a simple **CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Actions.  
It explains what changes were made and what this workflow file does.  
Weâ€™ll keep adding more complexity as the project grows, but hereâ€™s where we begin.  

---

## ðŸ“„ Current Workflow File (with explanations)

```yaml
# ðŸ‘‡ Name of the pipeline
name: start-ci
# This gives the workflow a name. Youâ€™ll see it in the GitHub Actions tab.

# ðŸ‘‡ The triggers that start the workflow
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main       # Run when code is pushed to the main branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]  # Run when a pull request targets main

  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual runs from the GitHub Actions UI

# ðŸ‘‡ The jobs section (defines what tasks the workflow will do)
jobs:
  build-test:          # Job name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest   # The environment (GitHub provides an Ubuntu VM)

    # ðŸ‘‡ Steps inside the job
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v5.0.0
        # This pulls the repository code into the runner so we can use it.

      - name: Setting up Python Dependencies
        uses: actions/setup-python@v6.0.0
        # This sets up a Python environment in the runner.

      - name: Install Dependencies For the application
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
        # Installs all required packages from requirements.txt

      - name: Run the test
        run: python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
        # Runs all tests in the tests/ folder with verbose output

# 🚀 Flask Social Media App – CI/CD Pipeline  

This repository contains a Flask-based social media application, created purely for **educational purposes**.  

The goal is to help other **aspiring DevOps Engineers** (like me) — especially those who don’t yet have access to a production-level experience but want to practice through **personal projects** — learn the path toward becoming a DevOps engineer.  

In this project, the pipeline will evolve step by step: starting with a basic **CI/CD setup** in GitHub Actions, then expanding to **Containerization**, **container orchestration with Kubernetes (on-prem)**, and finally **deploying to AWS cloud**.  

Along the way, we’ll also add a **monitoring and alerting system** — gathering application metrics with **Prometheus**, visualizing them with **Grafana dashboards**, and setting up **alerts** to be notified when something goes wrong.  

This way, the project will grow into a complete **end-to-end DevOps learning journey**

## 📌 Current Pipeline Status *(as of 2025-09-25)*  

✅ **Checkout the code** → The repository is pulled into the GitHub Actions runner.  
✅ **Install dependencies** → All required Python packages are installed.  
✅ **Run tests (or build)** → Ensures the Flask app works as expected.

🔜 **Planned Improvements:**  

- 🐳 **Build & publish Docker images** → Containerize the Flask application.  
- 📦 **Container orchestration with Kubernetes** → Run the app in a K8s cluster (on-prem).  
- ☁️ **Deploy to AWS** → Learn to deploy using AWS services (e.g., ECS, EKS, or EC2).  
- 📈 **Monitoring & alerting** → Add observability using **Prometheus** & **Grafana**.

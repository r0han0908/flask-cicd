This repository contains a simple CI/CD pipeline for a Flask-based social media application, created purely for educational purposes. The pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions to demonstrate how to automate build, test, and deployment workflows.

The goal is to help anyone, like me, who wants to become a DevOps Engineer, learn the fundamentals of building a CI/CD pipeline step by step. The README will be updated as changes are made to the pipeline so that the progress and improvements are documented clearly.

Current Status [2025-09-25]:
The pipeline currently performs the following steps:

Checkout the code → grab the repository so the GitHub Actions runner can use it.

Install dependencies → ensure the application has everything it needs to run.

Run tests (or build) → validate that the code works as expected.

Future updates will expand this pipeline to cover more advanced stages of continuous integration and deployment.
